# Vocal-Paralysis-and-Polyp-Diagnosis
This project was used to confirm the diagnosis of patients with vocal chord disorders (in particular vocal paralysis and polyps).

The analyzer code has been implemented in MATLAB. The analysis uses time and frequency domain analysis with particular focus on attributes such as standard deviation, fundamental frequency, shimmer, bandwidth, intensity and jitter of sample audio signals.

To run the code, open and run the MATLAB file in MATLAB.
